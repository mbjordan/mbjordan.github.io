Hi! I'm Matt Jordan.

I'm a husband, father and Node.js/JavaScript engineer. When I'm not riding my motorcycle or out getting into trouble with my son, I spend my days creating business-critical applications customized for large, national brands.

I have been writing software for about 8 years now and have a very strong focus on Functional JavaScript. I love open-source software, and am dedicated to contributing to a lot of different projects.
