title: Development Attack Plan
---

When developing an integration/application, there is a process (experimental) that should be used to ensure efficiently-developed, rock-solid code.

1. Gather all pertinent information & discuss initial plan.
	* This provides the opportunity to converse with all stakeholders and for the developers to have an initial idea of how to do the thing that is to be done.
2. Write the spec.
	* Writing the spec is one of the most important parts. It helps ensure that the developers and clients are all on the same page--but moreover, the client knows exactly what to expect (and its their fault for not reading the spec if they don't get what they want; geniuses).
3. Share spec with client & gather feedback (not approval/disapproval).
	* If you send the spec to the client, _make it very clear_ that you are not seeking approval or disapproval. Comments and feedback are fine, but they need to know that they are not in charge of the spec.
4. Begin Development.
5. Collaborate and review all code.
6. Test... Test... Test...
7. Deploy.

I figure the last four don't need much explanation beyond what they already are.
