Before you judge that statement by its face value, just read this....

I've dealt with front-end developers and read a slew of questions on StackOverflow.com where people perceive jQuery and JavaScript to be one in the same.

Here lately, I have had to explain to people that, while learning jQuery is not a bad thing, learning it before you learn JavaScript (at least the basics) is a very bad thing. Developers using jQuery get stuck on very basic issues because they simply don't know how pure JavaScript works.

jQuery, MooTools, Dojo, et al. are libraries built on JavaScript that provide an API of methods that make JS development easier and more cross-browser-reliable.

With the advent of Node.js, I am using more and more JavaScript, and less PHP, Python, etc. I love being able to build Web apps with JavaScript both in the back and front ends&mdash;but you can't build a Node.js app that pulls data dynamically from MongoDB using jQuery.

Now, I am not hating on jQuery (or any other library) in any way. In fact, I use jQuery all the time and love it. The difference is that I first had an adequate understanding of JavaScript.
